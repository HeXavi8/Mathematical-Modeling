## 数据包络分析Data Envelopment Analysis(DEA)

### What
By explicitly considering the use of multiple inputs (i.e. resources) and the generation of multiple outputs (i.e. services), linear programming method is used to compare the efficiency of multiple service units providing similar services. This technology is called data envelopment analysis (DEA)

### Why
Advantages of DEA:</br>
1. It can deal with multi input and multi output without building production function to evaluate parameters</br>
2. Not affected by input-output dimension</br>
3. Evaluate the efficiency with comprehensive index</br>
4. The weight is not affected by subjective factors</br>
5. Put forward the direction of improving the inefficient DMU</br>

Disadvantages of DEA:</br>
1. Only the relative efficiency of DMU is evaluated, not the absolute efficiency</br>
2. It is impossible to measure the negative output</br>
3. The choice of input and output in DEA method has a decisive influence on the result</br>
4. There must be enough DMUs to be evaluated by DEA method, and the number of DMUs to be evaluated should be twice or more than the sum of the number of inputs and outputs, otherwise most DMUs will be effective</br>

### How
We can use DEA analysis tools, such as deap

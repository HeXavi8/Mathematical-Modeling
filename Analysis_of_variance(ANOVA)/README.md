## 方差分析Analysis of variance (ANOVA)

### What:
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a collection of statistical models and their associated estimation procedures (such as the "variation" among and between groups) used to analyze the differences among means in a sample. ANOVA was developed by the statistician Ronald Fisher. The ANOVA is based on the law of total variance, where the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether two or more population means are equal, and therefore generalizes the t-test beyond two means.<br/>

### Why:
Advantages of ANOVA:<br/>
1. Robust design
2. Increases statistical power
In addition a two way ANOVA:
3. Looks at interaction between factors
4. Reduces random variability
5. Can look at effect on second variable after controlling the first variable

Disadvantages of ANOVA:<br/>
1. If null hypothesis is rejected, we know at least one group differs from others, but with a one way ANOVA and multiple groups, it may be difficult to determine which group is different
2. Assumptions need to be fulfilled

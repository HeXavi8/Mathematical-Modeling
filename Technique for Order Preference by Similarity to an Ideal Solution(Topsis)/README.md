## 优劣解距离法Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution(Topsis)

### What:
The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is a multi-criteria decision analysis method, which was originally developed by Ching-Lai Hwang and Yoon in 1981 with further developments by Yoon in 1987, and Hwang, Lai and Liu in 1993. TOPSIS is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest geometric distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS) and the longest geometric distance from the negative ideal solution (NIS).

### Why:
Advantages of TOPSIS:<br/>
1. It avoids the subjectivity of the data, does not need the objective function, does not need to pass the test, and can well describe the comprehensive impact of multiple impact indicators<br/>
2. There is no strict restriction on the data distribution, sample size and the number of indicators. It is flexible and convenient for both small sample data and large system with multiple evaluation units and multiple indicators<br/>

Disadvantages of TOPSIS:<br/>
1. As for the required data of each index, it will be somewhat difficult to select the corresponding quantitative index<br/>
2. Only by selecting the appropriate number of uncertain indicators can we describe the influence of indicators well<br/>
3. There must be more than two research objects before it can be used<br/>

### How:
The code has been written in Topsis.py and topsis.xlsx is the data file. Please download them both if you wanna try out.<br/>

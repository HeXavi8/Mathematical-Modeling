## 数据包络分析Data Envelopment Analysis(DEA)

### What
Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a nonparametric method in operations research and economics for the estimation of production frontiers. It is used to empirically measure productive efficiency of decision making units (DMUs). Although DEA has a strong link to production theory in economics, the tool is also used for benchmarking in operations management, where a set of measures is selected to benchmark the performance of manufacturing and service operations. In benchmarking, the efficient DMUs, as defined by DEA, may not necessarily form a “production frontier”, but rather lead to a “best-practice frontier” (Charnes A., W. W. Cooper and E. Rhodes (1978)).</br>

### Why
Advantages of DEA:</br>
1. It can deal with multi input and multi output without building production function to evaluate parameters</br>
2. Not affected by input-output dimension</br>
3. Evaluate the efficiency with comprehensive index</br>
4. The weight is not affected by subjective factors</br>
5. Put forward the direction of improving the inefficient DMU</br>

Disadvantages of DEA:</br>
1. Only the relative efficiency of DMU is evaluated, not the absolute efficiency</br>
2. It is impossible to measure the negative output</br>
3. The choice of input and output in DEA method has a decisive influence on the result</br>
4. There must be enough DMUs to be evaluated by DEA method, and the number of DMUs to be evaluated should be twice or more than the sum of the number of inputs and outputs, otherwise most DMUs will be effective</br>

### How
We can use DEA analysis tools, such as deap

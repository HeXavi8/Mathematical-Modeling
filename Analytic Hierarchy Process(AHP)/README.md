## 层次分析法Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP)

### what:
Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a decision analysis method which combines qualitative and quantitative methods to solve multi-objective complex problems. This method combines quantitative analysis with qualitative analysis, uses the experience of decision-makers to judge the relative importance of the standards to measure whether the objectives can be achieved or not, and reasonably gives the weight of each standard of each decision-making scheme, and uses the weight to calculate the priority of each scheme, which is more effectively applied to those problems that are difficult to be solved by quantitative methods.

### why:
AHP法 的优点：<br/>
1. 面对有层次结构的整体问题综合评价，逐层分解，然后在多个但准则评价的基础上进行综合<br/>
2. 简单实用，将定性与定量的方法结合起来<br/>
3. 所需定量数据较少<br/>

AHP法 的缺点：<br/>
1. 只能在给定的策略中选择最优的，而不能给出新的策略<br/>
2. AHP中所用的指标体系需要有专家系统的支持，如果给出的指标不合理，则得到的结果就会不正确<br/>
3. AHP进行多层比较时需要进行一致性检查，如果不满足一致性要求，那么AHP方法也就失去了作用<br/>
4. AHP方法需要求矩阵的特征值，对于某些病态矩阵来说，求出的特征值会有系统误差<br/>

Advantages of AHP method:<br/>
1. In the face of the comprehensive evaluation of the overall problem with hierarchical structure, it decomposes layer by layer, and then makes a comprehensive evaluation on the basis of multiple criteria <br/>
2. Simple and practical, combining qualitative and quantitative methods <br/>
3. Less quantitative data are needed <br/>

Disadvantages of AHP method:<br/>
1. We can only choose the best strategy from the given one, but can't give a new strategy <br/>
2. The index system used in AHP needs the support of expert system. If the index given is unreasonable, the result will be incorrect <br/>
3. Consistency check is needed when AHP is used for multi-layer comparison. If the consistency requirement is not met, the AHP method will lose its function <br/>
4. AHP method needs to find the eigenvalues of matrix. For some ill conditioned matrices, the eigenvalues will have systematic error <br/>

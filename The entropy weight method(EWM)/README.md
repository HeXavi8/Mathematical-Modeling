## 熵权法the entropy weight method(EWM) 

### What:
Entropy weight method (EWM) is a commonly used weighting method that measures value dispersion in decision-making. The greater the degree of dispersion, the greater the degree of differentiation, and more information can be derived. Meanwhile, higher weight should be given to the index, and vice versa.<br/>

### Why:
The advantages of EWM:<br/>
the biggest advantage of the EWM is theavoidance of the interference of human factors on the weightof indicators, thus enhancing the objectivity of the com-prehensive evaluation results. Therefore, the EWM hasbeen widely used in decision-making in recent years.<br/>

The disadvantages of EWM:<br/>
EWM only considered the numerical discrimination degree andignored the rank discrimination degree of the index. <br/>

### How:
The code had been written in EWM.py and the test data is in ewm.csv.<br/>

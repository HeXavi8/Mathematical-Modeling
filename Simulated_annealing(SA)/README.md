## 模拟退火法Simulated annealing(SA)

### What
In fact, simulated annealing is also a kind of greedy algorithm, but its search process introduces random factors. The simulated annealing algorithm accepts a worse solution than the current solution with a certain probability, so it may jump out of the local optimal solution and reach the global optimal solution.

### Why
Advantages of SA:</br>
1. The calculation process is simple</br>
2. It can be widely used</br>
3. Strong robustness</br>
4. It is suitable for parallel processing</br>
5. It can be used to solve complex nonlinear optimization problems</br>

Disadvantages of SA:</br>
1. The convergence speed is slow</br>
2. Long execution time</br>
3. The performance of the algorithm is related to the initial value and parameter sensitivity</br>

### How
The pseudocode was written in SA.txt

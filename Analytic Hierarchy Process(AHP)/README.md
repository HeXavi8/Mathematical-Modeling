## 层次分析法Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP)

### What:
Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a decision analysis method which combines qualitative and quantitative methods to solve multi-objective complex problems. This method combines quantitative analysis with qualitative analysis, uses the experience of decision-makers to judge the relative importance of the standards to measure whether the objectives can be achieved or not, and reasonably gives the weight of each standard of each decision-making scheme, and uses the weight to calculate the priority of each scheme, which is more effectively applied to those problems that are difficult to be solved by quantitative methods.

### Why:
Advantages of AHP:<br/>
1. In the face of the comprehensive evaluation of the overall problem with hierarchical structure, it decomposes layer by layer, and then makes a comprehensive evaluation on the basis of multiple criteria <br/>
2. Simple and practical, combining qualitative and quantitative methods <br/>
3. Less quantitative data are needed <br/>

Disadvantages of AHP:<br/>
1. We can only choose the best strategy from the given one, but can't give a new strategy <br/>
2. The index system used in AHP needs the support of expert system. If the index given is unreasonable, the result will be incorrect <br/>
3. Consistency check is needed when AHP is used for multi-layer comparison. If the consistency requirement is not met, the AHP method will lose its function <br/>
4. AHP method needs to find the eigenvalues of matrix. For some ill conditioned matrices, the eigenvalues will have systematic error <br/>

### How:
The code had been written in AHP.py.<br/>

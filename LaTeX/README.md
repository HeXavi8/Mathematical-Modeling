## LaTeX

### What:
LaTeX (/ˈlɑːtɛx/ LAH-tekh or /ˈleɪtɛx/ LAY-tekh, often stylized as LATEX) is a software system for document preparation. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in "What You See Is What You Get" word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MiKTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution.

### Why:
Advantages of Latex:<br/>
1. Professional typesetting
2. Best output
3. It is the standard for scientific documents
4. Processing Mathematical (& other) symbols
5. Meaning based structuring (rather than appearance)
6. Knowledgeable and helpful user group
7. Its FREE!
8. Platform independent
9. Professionally crafted layouts are available, which make a document really look as if “printed.”
10. Users only need to learn a few easy-to-understand commands that specify the logical structure of a document. They almost never need to tinker with the actual layout of the document.
11. Even complex structures such as footnotes, references, table of contents, and bibliographies can be generated easily.
12. Free add-on packages exist for many typographical tasks not directly supported by basic LATEX. For example, packages are available to include PostScript graphics or to typeset bibliographies conforming to exact standards.].
13. LATEX encourages authors to write well-structured texts, because this is how LATEX works—by specifying structure.
14. TEX, the formatting engine of LATEX, is highly portable and free. Therefore the system runs on almost any hardware platform available.

Disadvantages of Latex:<br/>
1. “Hard to write disorganized documents”*
2. Learning Curve
3. Customizing is tedious.
